# Inch-To-Cm

## hw

Write a Python program that converts between centimetres and inches. The pro-
gram asks the user to enter a single line of input containing a positive integer
number and a unit (either ’cm’ or ’in’) separated by a space e.g.
4 in

If the input is in inches, the program converts to the equivalent in centimetres and
prints the result in the following format
4in = 10.2 cm

The result should be displayed to one decimal place. (Centimetre inputs are con-
verted to inches and the result displayed in a similar fashion.) You may assume
that one inch is 2.54 centimetres.
